## Wins
	- A win for me was using Mocha and chai as my testing framework and library it was a new technology that I was not familiar with and I got a chance to do a lot of trials and errors witch gains me a lot of experience in the long run for future projects
	- Successes of this project was actully making the game to function with very few bugs/erros

## Challenges + Improvements
	- A big challenge for me was to actully connect all my classes to one big class in order to make the game all tie in together
	- A bug that I encounter is when a user is done answering a question it does not go to the next question the user must hit `enter` in their key-board in order to move on
	- What I would like to apply in the future would be fixing that bug that I encounter I would like the game to automatically go to the next question instead of the user to click `enter` twice in their key-board
